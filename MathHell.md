# Math hell...

The concept of mathematics was a bit far from the mathematics course I was learning in high school or undergraduate, so I think I was really bored. 
In fact, there are many basic concepts such as gcd (greatest common divisor), combination, factorial, matrix, etc. 
These were the problems that could be solved by writing the basics~basic~ well~ well~.
